# this interface should:
# take a song, match to all other songs essentially
# first, match each phrase exit boundary with all the phrase entry boundaries of the other song
# - Apply the premade transition at each point (simple one for now), allow to provide a ranking and some comments
# second, match each phrase entry bounary with all the phrase exit boundaries of the other song
# - Apply the premade transition at each point (simple one for now), allow to provide a ranking and some comments
# ensure we skip over already completed pairs, so not really n^2
# once we give a ranking, it should update the json format to be trained with 

# actually this only requires us to loop through the songs once, so this shouldnt be all that bad as matching a song
# with the others will only require us to check the rest of the list, as it has already been compared to songs before it

# the gui should include a music player button, to play the transition, and can allow the transition to be replayed.
# of course, we should make a copy of the original json here as to not overwrite the results from before
# example output format from this tool
